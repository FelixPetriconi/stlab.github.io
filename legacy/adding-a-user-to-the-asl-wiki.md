To create an account, someone with the right permissions must go to:

<http://stlab.adobe.com/wiki/index.php?title=Special:Userlogin&type=signup>

Make sure when you create the account you use the "by email" button; this will send off a password and login information to the supplied email address.

## Permission Problem?

If you go to that page and cannot see the form, you don't have permission. :-)

### I Really Need it!

OK; first someone who _does_ have permission to make user rights modifications needs to go to this page:

<http://stlab.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Special:Userrights>

They need to enter in your name, and elevate your user account to "Bureaucrat, sysop"

### Great; Who do I bug?

You can see the list of users with the proper permissions here:
